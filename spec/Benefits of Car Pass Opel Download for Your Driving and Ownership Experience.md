- Check your car's documents and manuals. Sometimes, the car pass is attached to the service book or the owner's manual. You may also find it in the glove box or under the spare wheel.
- Contact the previous owner or dealer. If you bought your car second-hand, you can try to contact the previous owner or the dealer and ask them if they have the car pass or know the code. They may have written it down somewhere or stored it in their records.
- Visit an Opel authorized repairer. If you can't find the car pass or contact the previous owner, you can visit an Opel authorized repairer and ask them to retrieve the code for you. They will need to connect your radio to a special device and read the code from its memory. However, this service may cost you some money, depending on the repairer.
- Use an online tool or software. There are some websites and software that claim to generate the code for your Opel radio based on its serial number. You can find the serial number on a sticker on the side or back of your radio. You may need to remove it from the dashboard to see it. However, be careful when using these tools, as they may not be reliable or safe. Some of them may require you to pay a fee or download a file that could contain malware.

Once you have the code, you can enter it into your radio by following these steps:

1. Turn on your radio. It should display "SAFE" on the screen.
2. Press and hold the AS button until you hear a beep and see "10 - - - -" on the screen.
3. Use the preset buttons 1 to 4 to enter each digit of your code. For example, if your code is 1234, press button 1 once, button 2 twice, button 3 three times, and button 4 four times.
4. Press and hold the AS button again until you hear a beep and see "LSM" on the screen.
5. Your radio should be unlocked and ready to use.

I hope this article helps you get a car pass for your Opel radio. If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know.
